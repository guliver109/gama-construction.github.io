                        <p> I remember as a kid, whenever I’d get asked the common question—”What do you want to do when you grow up?”—I’d smugly answer, “an Arhitect.” In my mind,this was an only good answer. Having been entrusted with some of the city’s most iconic buildings Oiver have earned Architecture Magazine’s Home of the Year Award, an National Honor Award, and even more accolades from Belgrades Business Council,AIA LA, and Residential Architects Magazine.
